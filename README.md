# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

## Overview
Welcome to my personal machine learning repository! This project serves as a collection of my implementations, experiments, and explorations with various machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented from scratch or using popular libraries, with explanations, use cases, and personal notes.


## Table of Contents  
- **Supervised Learning**  
  - Regression: Linear, Polynomial, Ridge, Lasso  
  - Classification: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, k-NN  

- **Unsupervised Learning**  
  - Clustering: k-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN  
  - Dimensionality Reduction: PCA  
  - Probabilistic Models: Gaussian Mixture Models  

- **Deep Learning**  
  - Neural Networks: MLP, CNN, RNN, LSTM  
  - Generative Models: Autoencoders, GANs  

- **Reinforcement Learning**  
  - Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Policy Gradients  

- **Evaluation Metrics**  
  - Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC  
  - Regression: MSE, RMSE, RÂ²  

Some of the algorith will be implemented in the future after I get to learn them
